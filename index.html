            <h3>Important Points To Note:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The price shown excludes other charges. This is the cost up until the japan warehouse.</li>
                <li>ISF and customs for a single photocard is less than 100. For multiple photocards, it will increase.</li>
                <li>ISF+customs for an album depends on its weight or volume, whichever is higher. For example, a 500g album will have an ISF+customs between 600-800. Heavier albums will incur a higher ISF+customs.</li>
                <li>Please conduct thorough due diligence regarding the items purchased. If the photocard or item is damaged or counterfeit from the seller's side, I am not responsible.</li>
                <li>For any other Japan-based purchases like Weverse or Amazon JP or for any queries, please DM.</li>
